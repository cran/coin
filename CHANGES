		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-3


    o    fix more problems reported by new `codetools'. Try to work around
         the `terms(y ~ ., data = data.frame(1:10))' problem in R-2.2.0.


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-2


    o   fix some problems reported by `codetools'


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-1


    o   alternative = "less" and alternative = "greater" are now defined
        for maxtype statistics as well

    o   one- and two-sided single-step and step-down maxT p-value
        adjustments are now available from the appropriate 
        `pvalue' method (NOTE: those procedures have not been tested
                         carefully, yet)

        In addition, the Bonferroni-adjustment by Westfall & Wolfinger
        (1997) is available now. Note that the interface to `pvalue'
        changed slightly, `adjustment = TRUE' was replaced by
        `method = "single-step"'.

    o   more examples added to the vignette.


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-14


    o   distribution = "approximate" for maxtype statistics was wrong
        in case both xtrafo _and_ ytrafo were multivariate (the conditional
        expectation was computed incorrectly)


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-13


    o   I() in formulae returns objects of class `AsIs' which caused
        troubles in `trafo'


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-12


    o   functionality for formula parsing and evaluation is now imported
        from package `modeltools'

    o   `show()' returns objects (of class `htest', for example) invisibly,
         really.

    o   `maxstat_trafo' is much faster now and returns a matrix with
        both row- and column names set appropriately


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-11


    o   the `distribution' argument now takes the return values of
        functions `exact()', `approximate()' or `asymptotic()' as well.
        Those functions can be used to specify parameters, such as the
        number of Monte-Carlo replications via
        ..., distribution = approximate(B = 9999), ...

    o   `show()' returns objects (of class `htest', for example) invisibly

    o   `expectation()' returns a vector, not a matrix

    o   new generic `variance()' for extracting the variance(s) of 
        linear statistics

    o   only variances (instead of the whole covariance matrix) is 
        computed when the distribution of maximum type test statistics 
        is to be _approximated_.

    o   `data' may be an object of class `exprSet' (-> Biobase), the
        vignette has an example

    o   `logrank_trafo' (and `surv_test') now have a `ties.method' argument,
        see ?surv_test for more information


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-10


    o   asymptotical -> asymptotic in print methods

    o   `mercuryfish' example added

    o   {x,y}trafo now can return matrices with number of columns
        different from the lhs and rhs of `formula'


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-9


    o	`mergesort' is already defined in `/usr/include/stdlib.h:270' on
	some platforms.

    o	`delay' is deprecated in R 2.1.0
