    o     no require() in .onLoad()


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-18

    o     exact() can not work for symmetry_test; spotted
          by LE PAPE Gilles <lepape.gilles@neuf.fr>


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-17

		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-16

    o     change `ties.method = c("HollanderWolfe", "Pratt")'
          to `zero.method = c("Pratt", "Wilcoxon")' in `wilcoxsign_test'
          following a suggestion by Fritz Scholz. A warning
          is fired to avoid misleading and nonreproducible results.


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-15

    o     use `quantile(..., type = 1)' for computing approximate
          quantiles (suggested by Fritz Scholz)

    o    improve upon `qperm' for van de Wiel algorithm again.


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-9

    o    again precision problems in van de Wiel algorithm:
         `qperm' suffered from too large tolerances of the
         inverted probability function.


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-8

    o    precision problems in van de Wiel algorithm
         fixed. In rare cases, P(T < t) was returned
         as p-value instead of P(T <= t). Two statistics
         are now considered equal (in all computations)
         when the difference is smaller than
         sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-7

    o    dperm, pperm and qperm are vectorized also
         for exact and approximate null distributions


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 1.0-6

    o    exact distribution for independent two-sample
         problems with only two observations was wrong,
         spotted by Fritz Scholz <fscholz@u.washington.edu>

         "General Independence Test"

    o    covariance() always returns a covariance matrix

    o    add show() method for <IndependenceTest> objects

    o    functions supplied via `distribution = ' doesn't need
         to have a class

    o    export all classes

         when constructing <IndependenceLinearStatistic> instead

    o    surv_test() ignored the `alternative' argument


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 0.5-2

    o    maxstat_trafo did not always choose the correct maximal
         cutpoint

    o    formula evaluation without `data' argument was partially broken

         a further example (thanks to Henric Nilsson <henric.nilsson@phadia.com>
         for pointing this out!).


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 0.4-7

    o    improve `maxstat_trafo': some potential cutpoints could have been
         overlooked in case of ties equal to the maxprob and minprob sample
         quantiles.

         univariate problems are currently allowed to have ordinal
         variables)

    o    export `independence_test.table'

    o    add `conf.level' attribute for `MCp' objects when quasi-randomized
         Monte-Carlo procedures (from `mvtnorm') have been used

    o    add new `var_trafo' argument to `trafo'

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 0.3-7

		CHANGES in `coin' VERSION 0.3-6

    o    internal C function `R_MonteCarloIndependenceTest' returns
         a (pq x B) matrix instead of a list with B elements
         (the linear statistic for each random permutation of the data)

    o    various simplifications for the computations of adjusted p-values

    o    I() in formulae could still cause trouble with class `AsIs', now
         fixed.

    o    logical variables are now allowed in formulae
         (and are treated like factors)

         x has no dim attribute

    o    new R-interface function `R_kronecker' to `C_kronecker' (which
         returns a _vector_!)

    o    speedup of variance computations in internal functions


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-3


    o    fix more problems reported by new `codetools'. Try to work around
         the `terms(y ~ ., data = data.frame(1:10))' problem in R-2.2.0.


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-2


    o   fix some problems reported by `codetools'


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.3-1


    o   alternative = "less" and alternative = "greater" are now defined
        for maxtype statistics as well

    o   one- and two-sided single-step and step-down maxT p-value
        adjustments are now available from the appropriate
        `pvalue' method (NOTE: those procedures have not been tested
                         carefully, yet)

        In addition, the Bonferroni-adjustment by Westfall & Wolfinger
        (1997) is available now. Note that the interface to `pvalue'
        changed slightly, `adjustment = TRUE' was replaced by
        `method = "single-step"'.

    o   more examples added to the vignette.


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-14


    o   distribution = "approximate" for maxtype statistics was wrong
        in case both xtrafo _and_ ytrafo were multivariate (the conditional
        expectation was computed incorrectly)


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-13


    o   I() in formulae returns objects of class `AsIs' which caused
        troubles in `trafo'


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-12


    o   functionality for formula parsing and evaluation is now imported
        from package `modeltools'

    o   `show()' returns objects (of class `htest', for example) invisibly,
         really.

    o   `maxstat_trafo' is much faster now and returns a matrix with
        both row- and column names set appropriately


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-11


    o   the `distribution' argument now takes the return values of
        functions `exact()', `approximate()' or `asymptotic()' as well.
        Those functions can be used to specify parameters, such as the
        number of Monte-Carlo replications via
        ..., distribution = approximate(B = 9999), ...

    o   `show()' returns objects (of class `htest', for example) invisibly

    o   `expectation()' returns a vector, not a matrix

    o   new generic `variance()' for extracting the variance(s) of
        linear statistics

    o   only variances (instead of the whole covariance matrix) is
        computed when the distribution of maximum type test statistics
        is to be _approximated_.

    o   `data' may be an object of class `exprSet' (-> Biobase), the
        vignette has an example

    o   `logrank_trafo' (and `surv_test') now have a `ties.method' argument,
        see ?surv_test for more information


		CHANGES IN `coin' VERSION 0.2-10


    o   asymptotical -> asymptotic in print methods

    o   `mercuryfish' example added

    o   {x,y}trafo now can return matrices with number of columns
        different from the lhs and rhs of `formula'

    o	`mergesort' is already defined in `/usr/include/stdlib.h:270' on
	some platforms.

    o	`delay' is deprecated in R 2.1.0
